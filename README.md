### Grid drawing system: 
You can draw on a grid which will be processed by the chosen algorithm. It make the link between user interface and array. This can be used as a base for ulterior projects.

---

### How to use it: 
Firstly, the user has a grid canvas, he can draw: a walkable tile, a obstacle, a point A and B. These can be chosen by pressing on the keys 1 to 4 of the keyboard.
**Warning**: Point A and a point B are mandatory for the algorithm to work.
He is able to reset the grid by pressing _R_ key and use the walkable tile as an eraser.
Then by pressing the _SPACE BAR_ he let the algorithm run on the grid he set up.
